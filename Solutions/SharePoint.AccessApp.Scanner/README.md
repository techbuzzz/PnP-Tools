# SharePoint Access App scanner #

### Summary ###
Using this command line utility you can scan your tenant for the presence of Access Apps. Access Apps are being retired and Microsoft will prevent you from adding new Access Apps and in the final phase of the retirement Microsoft will prevent from running your Access Apps. With the data obtained by this scanner you can plan for the needed remediation work.

# What will this tool do for you? #
The main purpose of this tool is to give you a report of Access 2010 and 2013 Apps that are present in your tenant. Access Apps are being retired and Microsoft will prevent you from adding new Access Apps and in the final phase of the retirement Microsoft will prevent from running your Access Apps. With the data obtained by this scanner you can plan for the needed remediation work.

# Quick start guide #
## Download the tool ##
You can download the tool from here:
 - [Access App scanner for SharePoint Online](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-Tools/blob/master/Solutions/SharePoint.AccessApp.Scanner/Releases/Access%20App%20scanner%20for%20SharePoint%20Online%20v1.0.zip?raw=true)

Once you've downloaded the tool (or alternatively you can also compile it yourself using Visual Studio) you have a folder containing the tool **AccessAppScanner.exe**. Start a (PowerShell) command prompt and navigate to that folder so that you can use the tool.

## Using the scanner for SharePoint Online ##
Since this tool needs to be able to scan all site collections it's recommended to use an app-only principal with tenant scoped permissions for the scan. This approach will ensure the tool has access, if you use an account (e.g. your SharePoint tenant admin account) then the tool can only access the sites where this user also has access.

### Setting up an app-only principal with tenant permissions ###
Below steps show how to setup the app-only principal with the needed permissions. Note that you'll need to he a SharePoint tenant administrator to complete these steps.

#### Create a new principal ####
Navigate to a site in your tenant (e.g. https://contoso.sharepoint.com) and then call the **appregnew.aspx** page (e.g. https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx). In this page click on the **Generate** button to generate a client id and client secret and fill the remaining information like shown in the screen-shot below.

![create app-only principal](http://i.imgur.com/2uD1JKY.png)

>**Important**
> - Store the retrieved information (client id and client secret) since you'll need this in the next step!

#### Grant permissions to the created principal ####
Next step is granting permissions to the newly created principal. Since we're granting tenant scoped permissions this granting can only be done via the **appinv.aspx** page on the tenant administration site. You can reach this site via https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx. Once the page is loaded add your client id and look up the created principal:

![Grant permissions to app-only principal](http://i.imgur.com/1vvvFFB.png)

In order to grant permissions you'll need to provide the permission XML that describes the needed permissions. Since the Access App scanner needs to be able to access all sites + also uses search with app-only it **requires** below permissions:

```xml
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
  <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/tenant" Right="FullControl" />
</AppPermissionRequests>
```

When you click on **Create** you'll be presented with a permission consent dialog. Press **Trust It** to grant the permissions:

![Trust principal](http://i.imgur.com/rwSmPWU.png)

>**Important**
> - Please safeguard the created client id/secret combination as would it be your administrator account. Using this client id/secret one **can read/update all data in your SharePoint Online environment**!

With the preparation work done let's continue with doing a scan. 

### Scanning SharePoint Online MT environment ###
Below option is the typical usage of the tool for most customers: you specify a mode, your tenant name and the created client id and secret. Please check out the **I'm running SharePoint Online dedicated** section if you need to scan a SharePoint Online Dedicated environment.

```console
accessappscanner -t <tenant> -c <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
accessappscanner -t contoso -c 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

You'll see the following output during the run:

After the run you'll find a new sub folder (e.g. 636299284487379655) which contains the following:

Report | Content
---------|----------
**AccessApps.csv** | Lists all the Access Apps that were detected by the scanner.
**Error.csv** | If the scan tool encountered errors then these are logged in this file.
**ScannerSummary.csv** | Logs the number of scanned site collections and webs. It will also contain information on scan duration and used scanner version.

# Report details
## Understanding the AccessApps.csv file
This report contains the following columns:

Column | Description
---------|----------
**Site Url** | Url of the Access App site.

**ViewsLifeTimeUnique** | Lifetime unique views for the site collection hosting this Access App (only 500 first search results are processed)

### Key takeaways from this report
Load the AccessApps.csv into Microsoft Excel and use below filters to analyze the received data

Filter | Takeaway
---------|----------
**No filter** | Will give you a list of all the found Access Apps. If the amount of found Access Apps is zero or the found Access Apps are not relevant anymore then it's strongly recommended to [disable Access Apps for your tenant](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-and-disable-Access-apps-in-your-organization-92e0f958-4b53-411a-8499-52acec00413e?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). 
**Web Template = ACCSVC#0** | Will give you all the Access 2013 Apps, meaning the Access Apps created using Access 2013+ where the data is living in SQL Azure. 
**Web Template = ACCSRV#0** | Will give you all the Access 2010 Apps, meaning the Access Apps created using Access 2010 where the data is living in SharePoint lists.
**Web Template = ACCSVC#0 AND Access 2013 App Last Accessed On in 2017** | Listing all Access 2013 Apps  that have been recently accessed gives you the list of Access Apps to remediate.
**Web Template = ACCSRV#0 AND Access 2010 App Last Modified By User On in 2017** | Listing all Access 2010 Apps that have had a recent change gives you the list of Access Apps to remediate.
**ViewsRecent = 0** | All the Access Apps of which the hosting site collection has not been visited in the last 14 days.

# Advanced topics #

## The tool seems to be very fast...did something go wrong?
The default setting of the tool is to use search to retrieve the list of Access App sites...and this approach is super fast, even on large environments. See the chapter on using enumeration in case you don't want to use the search based approach.

## I'm running SharePoint Online dedicated, is this different? ##
In SharePoint Online Dedicated one can have vanity url's like teams.contoso.com which implies that the tool cannot automatically determine the used url's and tenant admin center url. Using below command line switch you can specify the admin site url which is sufficient if you use the default search based retrieval.

```console
accessappscanner -a <tenantadminsite> -c <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
accessappscanner -a https://contoso-admin.contoso.com -c 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 
                 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

## I don't want to use search to find the sites...what other options are there?
In case you're concerned about the missing sites because they're not indexed you can always run the tool via site enumeration by specifying the **-q parameter**.


```console
accessappscanner -t <tenant> -c <clientid> -s <clientsecret> -q
```

A real life sample:

```console
accessappscanner -t contoso -c 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw= -q
```

### I only want to scan a few sites when not using search, can I do that? ##
Using the urls command line switch you can control which sites are scanned. You can specify one or more url's which can have a wild card. Samples of valid url's are:
 - https://contoso.sharepoint.com/*
 - https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite
 - https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/*

To specify the url's you can use the -r parameter as shown below:

```console
accessappscanner -r https://contoso.sharepoint.com/*,https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite,https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/* 
-c 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw= -q
```

### I'm running SharePoint Online dedicated, is this different when not using search? ##
In SharePoint Online Dedicated one can have vanity url's like teams.contoso.com which implies that the tool cannot automatically determine the used url's and tenant admin center url. Using below command line switches you can specify the site url's to scan and the tenant admin center url. Note that the urls need to be separated by a comma.

```console
accessappscanner -r <urls> -a <tenantadminsite> -c <clientid> -s <clientsecret> -q
```

A real life sample:

```console
accessappscanner -r https://team.contoso.com/*,https://mysites.contoso.com/* 
                 -a https://contoso-admin.contoso.com -c 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 
                 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
                 -q 
```

### How can I decrease the time it takes to scan the environment when not using search?
If you've a very large environment the scan will take a long time since it will have to process all sites in your tenant. Use below tips to speed up the scanning:
- Run the scan on an Azure VM hosted in the same region as your SharePoint Online tenant, this will optimize the network traffic between the scanner and SharePoint Online
- Use the -r (see later in the chapter) parameter to for example only scan the sites that start with A,B,C,D on one machine, E,F,G,H on the next one,...This way you can have parallel scans running each handling a subset of site collections. This however means you'll need to manually combine the resulting CSV files.
- Increase the number of threads, default is 10 but increasing to 20 can help on large environments. It will however not double the performance :-)


## I don't want to use app-only, can I use credentials? ##
The best option is to use app-only since that will ensure that the tool can read all site collections but you can also run the tool using credentials.

```console
accessappscanner -t <tenant> -u <user> -p <password>
```

A real life sample:

```console
accessappscanner -t contoso -u admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p mypassword
```

>**Note:**
>The account you're using needs to be a tenant admin account and needs to have access to all your sites if you want to get a complete report.

Let the tool figure out your urls (works only for SPO MT):
==========================================================
Using app-only (recommended!):
accessappscanner.exe -t <tenant> -c <your client id> -s <your client secret>

e.g. accessappscanner.exe -t contoso -c 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s
