# What will this tool do for you? #
The main purpose of this tool is to give you a set of reports that you can use to:
- Assess which sites are ready for "groupify": this report will give you "groupify" warnings and blockers which you can use to scope the sites to "groupify" and plan the needed remediation work
- Learn more about the site pages used in your tenant: knowing which pages you have and their characteristics (type, layout, web part data, usage) is important to prepare for modernizing (a subset of) these pages

# Quick start guide #
## Download the tool ##
You can download the tool from here:
 - [Modernization scanner for SharePoint Online](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-Tools/blob/master/Solutions/SharePoint.Modernization/Releases/SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner%20v1.1.zip?raw=true)

Once you've downloaded the tool you have a folder containing the tool **SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe**. Start a (PowerShell) command prompt and navigate to that folder so that you can use the tool.

> Note:
> If you want to compile the tool yourself you'll also need to have the SharePoint.Scanning solution available as this tools depends on the SharePoint Scanner framework to compile.

## Using the scanner for SharePoint Online ##
Since this tool needs to be able to scan all site collections it's recommended to use an app-only principal with tenant scoped permissions for the scan. This approach will ensure the tool has access, if you use an account (e.g. your SharePoint tenant admin account) then the tool can only access the sites where this user also has access. You can either use a an Azure AD application or a SharePoint app principal:
 - [Granting access via Azure AD App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread)
 - [Granting access via SharePoint App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azureacs)


Once the preparation work is done, let's continue with doing a scan.

### Scanning SharePoint Online environment - Groupify scan only ###
Below option is the typical usage of the tool for most customers: you specify the mode, your tenant name and the created client id and secret:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -m GroupifyOnly -t <tenant> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -m GroupifyOnly -t contoso -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

You'll see the following output during the run:

```console

After the run you'll find a new sub folder (e.g. 636519019371118441) which contains the following:

Report | Content
---------|----------
**ModernizationSiteScanResults.csv** | The main "groupify" report contains one row per site collection epxlaining which sites are ready to "groupify" with which warnings. It will also tell which "groupify" blockers it found and provide extensive information on the applied permission model.
**ModernizationWebScanResults.csv** | Having subsites is a potential "groupify" warning and this report contains "groupify" relevant information about each web. This information is also rolled up to the ModernizationSiteScanResults.csv report, so you only need this report if you want to get more details on the found warnings/blockers.
**ModernizationUserCustomActionScanResults.csv** | When a site is "Groupified" it will get a "modern" home page...and  user custom actions that embed script do not work on modern pages. This report contains all the site/web scoped user custom actions that do not work on modern pages. This information is also rolled up to the ModernizationSiteScanResults.csv report, so you only need this report if you want to get more details on the actual found user custom actions
**Error.csv** | If the scan tool encountered errors then these are logged in this file.
**ScannerSummary.csv** | Logs the number of scanned site collections, webs and list. It will also contain information on scan duration and used scanner version.

**GroupifyBlockers** | Lists the found blocking issues which is either `SiteHasOffice365Group` (site is already "groupified"), `PublishingFeatureEnabled` (publishing features are enabled) or `IncompatibleWebTemplate` (Web template is not ready for changes introduced by "groupify").
**GroupifyWarnings** | List of the found warnings: these indicate non optimal conditions for "groupifying" the site but these are not considered a blocker for "groupify". Following can be potential warnings: `ADGroupWillNotBeExpanded` (site uses AD groups which do not expand inside an Office 365 group), `SiteHasSubSites` (sub sites are discouraged in modern sites), `ModernUIIssues` (parts of the modern UI capability has been disabled or we've incompatible customizations) or `DefaultHomePageImpacted` ("groupify" will add a new modern home page which is too different from the default home page of the used web template).
**GroupMode** | Proposed group mode (private/public) based on the found security setup (presence of EveryOne claims).
**PermissionWarnings** | Consolidates permission related warnings. Following values can be shown: `PrivateGroupButEveryoneUsedOutsideOfAdminOwnerMemberGroups` (Office 365 group is marked as private, but an everyone claim was used making the SharePoint site more open than the Office 365 group), `SharingDisabledForSiteButGroupWillAllowExternalSharing` (External sharing was disabled for the SharePoint site, but an Office 365 group will by default allow external sharing) or `SubSiteWithBrokenPermissionInheritance` (site has sub sites with unique permissions).

### Key takeaways from this report
Load the PageScanResults.csv into Microsoft Excel and use below filters to analyze the received data

Filter | Takeaway
---------|----------
**No filter** | Will give you one row per scanned page
**HomePage = TRUE** | Gives you all the site home pages
**Type = "WebPartPage"** | Gives you all the web part pages
**ViewsRecent > 0** | Pages which have been recently accessed

### WPData details
For each exported web part the same base JSON structure is used as shown below. Important to note are:
- The "Row" property indicates the row (=section) this web part should be added into in a new client side page (assuming the layout of the original page was detected)
- The "Column" property indicates the column this web part should be added into in a new client side page (assuming the layout of the original page was detected)
- The "Properties" property holds the web part specific properties

```JSON
{
	"Type":"<fully qualified web part type>",
	"Id":"6f930c6f-b7d5-44db-b6e7-55d375e4667d",
	"ServerControlId":"6f930c6f-b7d5-44db-b6e7-55d375e4667d",
	"ZoneId":"FullPage",
	"Hidden":false,
	"IsClosed":false,
	"Title":"<web part title>",
	"Row":1,
	"Column":1,
	"Order":0,
	"ZoneIndex":0,
	"Properties":{"<web part specific properties>"}
}
```

Since each web part has different **relevant** properties the properties that are exported for a web part are defined in the `webpartmapping.xml` file: this allows you to add/remove properties based on your needs. Each defined property is exported and stored underneath the "Properties" property as shown in below complete example:

```JSON
{
	"Type":"Microsoft.Office.Visio.Server.WebControls.VisioWebAccess, Microsoft.Office.Visio.Server, Version=16.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71e9bce111e9429c",
	"Id":"6f930c6f-b7d5-44db-b6e7-55d375e4667d",
	"ServerControlId":"6f930c6f-b7d5-44db-b6e7-55d375e4667d",
	"ZoneId":"FullPage",
	"Hidden":false,
	"IsClosed":false,
	"Title":"Visio Web Access",
	"Row":1,
	"Column":1,
	"Order":0,
	"ZoneIndex":0,
	"Properties":
	{
		"Title":"Visio Web Access",

## Understanding the UniqueWebParts.csv file
This report contains the following columns:

Column | Description
---------|----------
**Type** | Fully qualified name of the web part.
**InMappingFile** | Indicates if this web part is listed in the webpartmapping file.

### Key takeaways from this report
Load the UniqueWebParts.csv into Microsoft Excel and use below filters to analyze the received data

Filter | Takeaway
---------|----------
**No filter** | Will give you one row per uniquely detected web part
**InMappingFile = FALSE** | Gives you all the web parts which are not part of the webpartmapping.xml file. If these are important for you it's best to define these web parts with the properties you want to retrieve

## I'm running SharePoint Online dedicated, is this different? ##
In SharePoint Online Dedicated one can have vanity url's like teams.contoso.com which implies that the tool cannot automatically determine the used url's and tenant admin center url. Using below command line switches you can specify the site url's to scan and the tenant admin center url. Note that the urls need to be separated by a comma.

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -a <tenantadminsite> -r <wildcard urls> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -a <tenantadminsite> -r <wildcard urls> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly
                                 -a https://contoso-admin.contoso.com 
                                 -r "https://teams.contoso.com/sites/*,https://portal.contoso.com/*"
                                 -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -a https://contoso-admin.contoso.com 
                                 -r "https://teams.contoso.com/sites/*,https://portal.contoso.com/*"
                                 -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=

## I want to use an Azure AD app to authenticate, how do I that?
This scanner, like all scanners built using the SharePoint Scanner framework, do support Azure AD App-Only:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -t <tenant> -i <Azure App ID> -z <Azure AD Domain> 
                                 -f "<Path to PFX file holding your certificate" -x <Password for the PFX file>

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t <tenant> -i <Azure App ID> -z <Azure AD Domain> 
                                 -f "<Path to PFX file holding your certificate" -x <Password for the PFX file>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -t contoso -i e4108e9b-9865-44a9-c6e1-9003db04a775 -z contoso.onmicrosoft.com  
                                 -f "C:\scanning\AzureADAppOnlyScanning.pfx" -x pwd

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t contoso -i e4108e9b-9865-44a9-c6e1-9003db04a775 -z contoso.onmicrosoft.com  
                                 -f "C:\scanning\AzureADAppOnlyScanning.pfx" -x pwd
```

## I don't want to use app-only, can I use credentials? ##
The best option is to use app-only since that will ensure that the tool can read all site collections but you can also run the tool using credentials.

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -t <tenant> -u <user> -p <password>

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t <tenant> -u <user> -p <password>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -t contoso -c admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p mypassword

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t contoso -c admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p mypassword
```

Let the tool figure out your urls (works only for SPO MT):
==========================================================
Using Azure AD app-only:
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t <tenant> -i <your client id> -z <Azure AD domain> -f <PFX file> -x <PFX file
password>
e.g. SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t contoso -i e5808e8b-6119-44a9-b9d8-9003db04a882 -z conto.onmicrosoft.com
-f apponlycert.pfx -x pwd

Using app-only:
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t <tenant> -i <your client id> -s <your client secret>
e.g. SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t contoso -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s
eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=

Using credentials:
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t <tenant> -u <your user id> -p <your user password>

e.g. SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t contoso -u spadmin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p pwd

Specifying url to your sites and tenant admin (needed for SPO Dedicated):
=========================================================================
Using Azure AD app-only:
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -r <wildcard urls> -a <tenant admin site>  -i <your client id> -z <Azure AD
domain> -f <PFX file> -x <PFX file password>
e.g. SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -r "https://teams.contoso.com/sites/*,https://my.contoso.com/personal/*" -a
https://contoso-admin.contoso.com -i e5808e8b-6119-44a9-b9d8-9003db04a882 -z conto.onmicrosoft.com  -f apponlycert.pfx
-x pwd

Using app-only:
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -r <wildcard urls> -a <tenant admin site> -i <your client id> -s <your client
secret>
e.g. SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -r "https://teams.contoso.com/sites/*,https://my.contoso.com/personal/*" -a
https://contoso-admin.contoso.com -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s
eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
